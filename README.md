# GiphyAPI-InfiniteScroll

# Requirements

Build a simple iPhone app to search and display gifs using the Giphy API. Follow instructions and write simple, elegant code.

- App should have a search field at the top to allow text input
- Results are shown in a grid (2 gifs per row)
- Use pages of 20 items, with infinite scrolling
- You can use third party libraries either with Cocoapods or Carthage. The only exception is Giphy Core SDK ( https://github.com/Giphy/giphy-ios-sdk-core ) as we expect you to build the Networking and Model layers.
